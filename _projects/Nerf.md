## About

Single image to 3d reconstruction is quite an exciting field. We in this report, have explored and implemented a single view image to fast and high-resolution 3d reconstruction pipeline based off an open-source stable-dreamfusion baseline. We managed to achieve resolution reconstructions with satisfactory visual effects, fine detail and realistic texture.
