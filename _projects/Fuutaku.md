## Intro

We developed this minigame in two weeks with a group of 7. I was the principal developer of this project.
Fuutaku is a two-player online decryption game in which the protagonists utilize color elimination and size alteration abilities to reach the destination. The inspiration originates from Color Blindness and Spatial Disorientation.

## Demo

Here is the live demonstration of the completion of the game (Fuutaku). Both individuals are controlling Colors and Space respectively. Since this game jam took place in Shenzhen, China, the audio and subtitles are in Chinese, but it does not hinder viewing and understanding.
