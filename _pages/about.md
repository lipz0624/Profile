Hi there! I am currently applying for graduate schools in 24fall :)

My research interests:

- **Computer Graphics**: Animations, Particle-based Simulations, Real-time Rendering
- **Robotics**: Motion Planning
- **HCI**: Emotion Recognition, Brain Computer Interfaces

I hope to innovate the next-generation of entertainment and virtual experiences and build a sophisticated and emotionally resonant virtual world in which people can connect and resonate.

I was a game developer of [PUBGM](https://www.pubgmobile.com/en-US/home.shtml) at [Tencent](https://www.tencent.com/en-us/) for two years. I graduated from the [University of Richmond](https://www.richmond.edu/) with a double major in Psychology and Computer Science in 2021. I was fortunate to work with [Dr.Denny](http://www.mathcs.richmond.edu/~jdenny/index.php) in my college.

In my spare time, I love dancingüíÉ, travelingüó∫Ô∏è, animalsüêïüêà.

Fun fact: I have two cats. Yet, I declare as a dog person :)
